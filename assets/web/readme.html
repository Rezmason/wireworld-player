	<h2>What is this thing?</h2>
	<p>
		Wireworld is a type of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automata" target="_blank">cellular automaton</a>, or CA.
		CAs are sets of rules that act on a grid of cells to produce a new grid of cells. Specifically, each cell in the old grid uses
		these rules and knowledge of itself and of its neighbors to determine its next state. CAs demonstrate how simple systems
		can express complex behaviors.<br/>
	</p>
	<p>
		Wireworld is a CA developed by <a href="http://llk.media.mit.edu/projects/emergence/" target="_blank">Brian Silverman</a>.
		Its rules are very simple, yet they allow it to exhibit behavior similar to circuitry. Wireworld instances have been built
		to perform computations. The point of that exercise is not to create computers that run at speeds
		comparable to physical computers, but instead to demonstrate a phenomenon called
		"<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing-complete" target="_blank">universality</a>".<br/>
	</p>

	<p>
		A universal computational system is able to compute any information that is computable. Counterintuitively, many CAs have
		exhibited universality; Wireworld is one of them.
		<a href="http://quinapalus.com/wi-index.html" target="_blank">David Moore and Mark Owen</a> demonstrate this
		with their Wireworld computer, which not only computes things, but can even be programmed to compute one thing
		rather than another.<br/>
	</p>

	<h2>What is Wireworld's rule set?</h2>
	<p>
		Wireworld cells can have one of four states. We call them <b>DEAD</b>, <b>WIRE</b>, <b>HEAD</b> and <b>TAIL</b>.<br/>
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>DEAD</b> cells always become <b>DEAD</b> cells.</li>
		<li><b>TAIL</b> cells always become <b>WIRE</b> cells.</li>
		<li><b>HEAD</b> cells always become <b>TAIL</b> cells.</li>
		<li>
			<b>WIRE</b> cells become <b>HEAD</b> cells only if they currently touch one or two <b>HEAD</b> cells.
			We call such a <b>WIRE</b> cell "excited". Otherwise they become <b>WIRE</b> cells.
		</li>
	</ul><br/>
	<p>
		Much of the time a WIRE cell doesn't get excited, which may lead you to think that they are mundane. In fact,
		they constrain the spread of information along certain channels, which helps to perform operations quickly and efficiently.
		Because of <b>WIRE</b> cells, Wireworld is a more predictable and comprehensible CA.<br/>
	</p>
	<p>
		Wireworld's excitation rule is not unique among CAs, but it is nonetheless crucial to the way Wireworld works.
		It allows information to spread cheaply and quickly, but also controls the flow of information– whether it continues to spread
		or whether it stops. There are many examples of simple Wireworld components that control information in useful ways;
		the Owen Moore computer makes use of several of these.<br/>
	</p>
	<h2>How do I make a Wireworld instance?</h2>
	<p>
		What, seriously? Wow. Good for you.<br/>
	</p>
	<p>
		Wireworld Player supports two file types: .MCL, a common CA format which isn't very amateur-friendly, and .TXT, which you can modify
		in any text editor. <a href="http://rezmason.net/wireworld/examples/txt/test/simple.txt" target="_blank">Click here</a> to see
		an example of a TXT file that the player supports.<br/>
	</p>
	<p>
		A built-in Wireworld editor might be added to the player in the future.<br/>
	</p>

	<h2>Why are you doing this?</h2>
	<p>
		CAs make great test subjects for code optimization strategies, and Wireworld is a CA that is fairly simple to put together–
		most of its cells never change, and the size of the grid never grows or shrinks.<br/>
	</p>
	<p>
		I use the Wireworld Player to experiment with new ways to improve the efficiency of my code, and to demonstrate
		the web's potential as a high-performance creative and experimental platform.
