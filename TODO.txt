TODO

Auto engine
	Two workersâ€” flat and macrocell
		Wrapped in a third worker, maybe?
	Both internal workers are initialized to the same state
	If turbo is on or speed is at full,
		Both engines are told to advance
		Initial state is "flat"
		states
			"flat"
				both engines run
				flat engine drives the renderer
				When the macrocell engine is faster AND further along than the flat engine,
					set state to "macrocell"
			"macrocell"
				only macrocell engine runs
				macrocell engine drives the renderer
				When the recent macrocell engine speed drops below a specific threshold,
					copy macrocell's state to "flat"
					set state to "flat"
	When turbo is off and speed is not at full,
		copy macrocell's state to "flat"
		set state to "flat"
	When tapping "step" (aka "advance") and not running
		copy macrocell's state to "flat"
		set state to "flat"

Hashlife investigation (ongoing)

Flatten macrocell
	Allocate giant buffer
		It should allocate pretty quickly, because it's one object
	Replace interlinked objects with addresses into the buffer

Sliders and selects should have labels in a11y mode

BUG: fix turbo-on issue in Firefox

BUG: fix focus-within issue with popup buttons in Chrome and Firefox

Photosensitivity warning
	Detect intense flickering, and replace with "epilepsy guard" color

Hybrid engine, conventional + HashLife
	Maybe an opportunity to create a more intuitive UI regarding speed control

New UI

EPISODE Milestone: gallery
	Most of the files are small!
	Load their data straight to canvas for preview images
	"Move" everything to RLE
		Load paths, authors from JSON

Milestone: better mobile experience
	Rethink the whole UI, really
		Popups are bad
		Toolbars are bad in portrait orientation

Milestone: pan with arrow keys
	pan: "Arrow(Left, Right, Up, Down)"
	pan faster: [shift arrow keys]

Milestone: drag-and-drop themes
	Merveilles themes
	Old Wireworld themes

Milestone: switch favicon to indicate sim is running

Milestone: EDITOR FUNCTIONALITY
	Research Computer Aided Circuit Design (thanks, Dad!)
	Look at Mike Ash's editor in classic Mac emulator
	Drawing wires, then painting electrons along wires
		Painting electrons could be like choosing a distance, a start point and an end point
	Simplify the construction and instantiation of COMPONENTS
		Components can contain multiple "snapshots" of electrons
		Global snapshots?
		Save and load format should persist all this
	Don't assume the user will run the simulator an exact number of steps just to recover an electron state
