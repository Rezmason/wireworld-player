TODO

Hashlife all by yourself
	Least Recently Used cache
		Dictionary backed by doubly linked list
		Pool removed macrocells
			Macrocells KEEP THEIR GUIDS for when they're used again
				Keep an eye on cells-in-use count

		"usage" = any reference, any "lookup" operation
			Result, computation
			Child?

		How do we prevent a child from being collected?
			"touch" in lookup
			"touch" in getComputedResult
				recursive
			"touch" in "touchCell"
				recursive

		Maybe have different garbage collection policies for different macrocell levels
		

	BUG: Macrocell engine has delayed response to messages

Default engine should be specified in wireworld module, transmitted to GUI

Sliders and selects should have labels in a11y mode
