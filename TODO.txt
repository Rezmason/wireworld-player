Hashlife all by yourself


	Memory management
		Dumping the cache when you reach its limit throws away too much work and costs too much to do
			We don't know what all is being reconstructed, but a lot of it can probably stay in place

	Least Recently Used cache
		Dictionary backed by doubly linked list
		Pool removed macrocells
			Macrocells KEEP THEIR GUIDS for when they're used again
				Keep an eye on cells-in-use count

		"usage" = any reference, any "lookup" operation
			Result, computation
			Child?

		How do we prevent a child from being collected?
			"touch" in lookup
			"touch" in getComputedResult
				recursive
			"touch" in "touchCell"
				recursive

		Maybe have different garbage collection policies for different macrocell levels

When is HashLife ready for the main branch?
	Caching issue
		Make it a non-default engine
	Interactive step size choice
		Replace turbo with dropdown:
			1x
			Turbo 1x
			Turbo 2x
			Turbo 4x
			Turbo 8x
			Turbo 16x
			etc
		Or maybe a weird slider
			Like a stick shift, I dunno

Sliders and selects should have labels in a11y mode

BUG: fix turbo-on issue in Firefox

BUG: fix focus-within issue with popup buttons in Chrome and Firefox

Photosensitivity warning
	Detect intense flickering, and replace with "epilepsy guard" color

Hybrid engine, conventional + HashLife
	Maybe an opportunity to create a more intuitive UI regarding speed control

New UI

EPISODE Milestone: gallery
	Most of the files are small!
	Load their data straight to canvas for preview images
	"Move" everything to RLE
		Load paths, authors from JSON

Milestone: better mobile experience
	Rethink the whole UI, really
		Popups are bad
		Toolbars are bad in portrait orientation

Milestone: pan with arrow keys
	pan: "Arrow(Left, Right, Up, Down)"
	pan faster: [shift arrow keys]

Milestone: drag-and-drop themes
	Merveilles themes
	Old Wireworld themes

Milestone: switch favicon to indicate sim is running
