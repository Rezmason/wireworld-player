TODO

Put previous implementations in other engines
	Make new engines based on old strategies
		Extract common code, use importScripts to add it to all engines
		"naive"
			model every cell in the sim, including dead ones
			update
				loop over all cells
				switch
				nested adjacency loop
			render
				every cell
		"alive"
			only model the non-dead cells
			update
				loop over non-dead cells
				switch
				nested adjacency loop
			render
				every head and tail
		"neighbors"
			model cells as objects with fields
				neighbor array
			update
				loop over non-dead cells
				switch
				neighbor loop
			render
				every head and tail
		"linked"
			model linked lists with object fields
			update
				loop over heads
				neighbor loop
				loop over newHeads
				loop over tails
			render
				every head and tail
		"flat"
			model cells and linked lists as data in a buffer
			(This already exists!)
	Add UI for player to specify what engine they want

New engines?
	Maybe WebGL and WebGPU?
		These don't go in a web worker
	Maybe WebAssembly?
		Make sure CORS isn't a problem

BUG: fix turbo-on issue in Firefox

BUG: fix focus-within issue with popup buttons in Chrome and Firefox

Photosensitivity warning
	Detect intense flickering, and replace with "epilepsy guard" color

EPISODE Milestone: gallery
	Most of the files are small!
	Load their data straight to canvas for preview images
	"Move" everything to RLE
		Load paths, authors from JSON

Milestone: better mobile experience
	Rethink the whole UI, really
		Popups are bad
		Toolbars are bad in portrait orientation

Milestone: pan with arrow keys
	pan: "Arrow(Left, Right, Up, Down)"
	pan faster: [shift arrow keys]

Milestone: drag-and-drop themes
	Merveilles themes
	Old Wireworld themes

Milestone: switch favicon to indicate sim is running
