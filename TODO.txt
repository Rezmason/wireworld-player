TODO

Hashlife all by yourself
	First, macrocells
		Canonicalized quadtree of cached macrocells: check
		Render function: check
		Reset function: check


		UPDATE FUNCTION
			Some notion of step size

		Separate result cache?
		Remove unused macrocells (Least Recently Used cache)
			Maybe macrocells can be in a doubly linked list
				When used, a macrocell is snipped from the list and prepended
					AND SO ARE ALL ITS CHILDREN AND RESULTS
					Maybe this is a bad idea?
				Removal would just be taking N macrocells off the doubly linked list and deleting them from the map
			Pool removed macrocells
			Macrocells KEEP THEIR GUIDS for when they're used again
				Keep an eye on maximum GUID

Default engine should be specified in wireworld module, transmitted to GUI

Sliders and selects should have labels in a11y mode
