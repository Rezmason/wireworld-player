	Strategy 3

	BUG: loading a file resets the engine's speed incorrectly
	BUG: changing speed with keys behaves strangely
	BUG: focus doesn't work properly in Chrome
	
	Small improvements
		Canvas drawing

			Update function should take arguments, not data
			Make base canvas opaque
			Move colors into CSS?

Make it easy to benchmark different techniques
Make it easy to use different computing strategies

Photosensitivity warning
Detect intense flickering, and replace with "epilepsy guard" color
